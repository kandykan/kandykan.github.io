 abstract = {The term \textit{zhen} in the Zhuangzi is commonly associated with the \textit{zhen ren} or the "true person," who is described, for example, as capable of going through fire and water unharmed. Some scholars take this as typifying a mystical element in the \textit{Zhuangzi}. This essay investigates the various meanings and uses of \textit{zhen} in the \textit{Zhuangzi} and reaches a broader understanding of the \textit{zhen ren} in various contexts.},
