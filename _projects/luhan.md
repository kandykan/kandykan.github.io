**ELLE:**
What do you think makes acting fun?

**Luhan:**
Right now, I'm only really acting as myself, so I don't have strong feelings, but I can totally understand how when you challenge yourself to act in a role that’s different, you can, like, you can experience a different life.
I am willing to empty myself and let another kind of life fill in.

**ELLE:**
Seeing that you have a very simple black hairstyle right now, is this some kind signal that you’re going *au naturel*?

**Luhan:**
From my debut till now, the thing I haven't actually tried is this simple style.
I personally like to try out various different styles and looks.
I really want to challenge myself. I can’t really do so in normal life. So I’m taking the opportunities I get as an artist to challenge myself.
It's been a long time since I tried a more natural and simple style, so I really wanted to do it.
It feels pretty good, simple.
(Laughs) Keep it simple, and you don’t have to think too much.
A simple appearance can create a different atmosphere, and you can get that feeling by looking at yourself in the mirror.

**ELLE:**
How would you describe your current state?

**Luhan:**
Facing everything bravely, and also creating a new starting point.
My motivation for starting over, first of all, is my fans and friends and, second, my family and all the people around me who helped me. I want to repay them, give them a gift.

**ELLE:**
What kind of people do you like and admire?

**Luhan:**
Hmm... First of all, you have to be loyal... how do you put it, getting along with me is actually kind of tiring... that is, I am not easy to get along with, and it takes a long time to understand me.

**ELLE:**
What do you do when others hurt you?

**Luhan:**
It depends on the situation, I think.
Being in this career, for sure, I don't care too much anymore.
I used to care, but in order to maintain public image, even if you are innocent and others say you are wrong, it’s useless to say more.

**ELLE:**
You grew up in a good environment.
Do you think the world is more light or dark?

**Luhan:**
More light, but I always think about the dark side of things.
Every time I start to do a new thing, I try my best to lower my expectations of how it will turn out. But I don’t lower my expectations for myself. I always go all out.
Then if it turns out well, I’m very happy.
I’m the type of person with high expectations for himself.

**ELLE:**
What do you think of your appearance?

**Luhan:**
I’m very shy. When people say (I’m handsome), I get embarrassed, yeah.
I don’t pay much attention to my looks.

**ELLE:**
In a relationship, what kind of temperament or quality do you look for the most in a girl?
What is your ideal relationship?

**Luhan:**
Kind and warm.
I think love is like playing soccer. You have to be persistent.

**ELLE:**
If you have a child in the future, how will you educate him/her?

**Luhan:**
I want him to be a good person, to be an ordinary person with a normal worldview and values, and a person of integrity.
I’ll see what he likes to do and let him keep doing what he likes. As long as he grows up without regrets.

**ELLE:**
What do you cherish right now?

**Luhan:**
The time I spend with my family. I’ve been away for too long, and I missed too many moments... Let’s just stop here, okay.

**ELLE:**
What is your New Year's wish?

**Luhan:**
That everyone is happy and healthy.
That time passes a little slower.
