My family name is <ruby><span lang="zh">張</span> <rt>Zhang</rt></ruby>&nbsp;. It means something like 'bowyer' or 'archer'. The pronunciation that I prefer in English is [<span style="font-weight: bolder;">dʒɑŋ</span>]: [<span style="font-weight: bolder;">dʒ</span>] as in _<u>J</u>ohn_, [<span style="font-weight: bolder;">ɑ</span>] as in _c<u>a</u>r_, and [<span style="font-weight: bolder;">ŋ</span>] as in _so<u>ng</u>_.

My legal given name is Katherine. Most people should use this name to refer to me.

My Chinese given name is <ruby><span lang="zh">采</span> <rt>Cai</rt> <span lang="zh">真</span> <rt>zhen</rt></ruby>&nbsp;. It comes from the following passage in the writings of [Zhuangzi](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zhuangzi/).

> <span lang="zh">古之至人，假道於仁，託宿於義，以遊逍遙之虛，食於苟簡之田，立於不貸之圃。逍遙，无為也；苟簡，易養也；不貸，无出也。古者謂是<u>采真</u>之遊。</span>

<span class="caption" style="text-align: right;">— ICS Zhuangzi 14/39/27-28</span>[^1]

Here are two translations of the last sentence:

> _... The ancients called this the outward visible sign of <u>an inward and spiritual grace</u>._

<span class="caption" style="text-align: right;">— Herbert Giles</span>[^2]

> _... The ancients called this the Enjoyment that <u>Collects the True</u>._

<span class="caption" style="text-align: right;">— James Legge</span>[^3]

<span lang="zh">采</span> means 'collect', and <span lang="zh">真</span> means 'true'. Together, in the context of this passage, <span lang="zh">采真</span> may refer to true human nature.[^4]
