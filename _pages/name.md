My family name is <ruby><span lang="zh">張</span> <rt>Zhang</rt></ruby>&nbsp;. It means something like 'bowyer' or 'archer'. The pronunciation that I prefer in English is [<span style="font-weight: bolder;">dʒɑŋ</span>]: [<span style="font-weight: bolder;">dʒ</span>] as in _**J**ohn_, [<span style="font-weight: bolder;">ɑ</span>] as in _c**a**r_, and [<span style="font-weight: bolder;">ŋ</span>] as in _so**ng**_.

My legal given name is Katherine. Most people should use this name to refer to me.

My Chinese given name is <ruby><span lang="zh">采</span> <rt>Cai</rt> <span lang="zh">真</span> <rt>zhen</rt></ruby>&nbsp;. It comes from the writings of [Zhuangzi](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zhuangzi/). <span lang="zh">采</span> means 'pick, gather', and <span lang="zh">真</span> refers to 'true' human nature.
