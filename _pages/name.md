My family name is <span lang="zh">張</span><d-footnote>张 in cursive and simplified Chinese, <i>Zhāng</i> in Mandarin romanization</d-footnote>. It means something like 'bowyer' or 'archer'. The pronunciation that I prefer in English is <span style="font-weight: normal;">[dʒɑŋ]</span>: 

- <span style="font-weight: normal;">[dʒ]</span> as in _**J**ohn_, 
- <span style="font-weight: normal;">[ɑ]</span> as in _c**a**r_, and 
- <span style="font-weight: normal;">[ŋ]</span> as in _so**ng**_.

My legal given name is **Katherine**. Most people should use this name to refer to me.

My Chinese given name is <span lang="zh">采真</span><d-footnote><i>Cǎizhēn</i> in Mandarin romanization</d-footnote>. It comes from the following passage in the writings of [Zhuangzi](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zhuangzi/).

> <span lang="zh" style="font-style: normal; text-emphasis-position: under;">古之至人，假道於仁，託宿於義，以遊逍遙之虛，食於苟簡之田，立於不貸之圃。逍遙，无為也；苟簡，易養也；不貸，无出也。古者謂是<span style="text-emphasis: circle;">采真</span>之遊。</span>

Here are two translations of the last sentence:

> The ancients called this the Enjoyment that <u>Collects the True</u>.

> The ancients called this the outward visible sign of <u>an inward and spiritual grace</u>.

As interpreted by Legge literally, <span lang="zh">采</span> means 'collect', and <span lang="zh">真</span> means 'true'. But less literally, in the context of this passage, <span lang="zh">采真</span> seems to refer to true human nature.<d-cite key="chong2011"></d-cite>
