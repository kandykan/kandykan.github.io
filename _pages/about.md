I am a translator and a linguist. I translate from Mandarin Chinese (and sometimes French) into English. My areas of specialty in translation include video game localization and literature.

I have also done computational linguistic research at CMU's [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), the machine translation start-up [Unbabel](https://unbabel.com), and [ÉTS Montréal](https://www.etsmtl.ca).

Outside of work, I also really enjoy beef noodle soup, _Star Wars_, and [pressing crosswalk buttons](/blog/)! My hometown is [Oak Ridge, Tennessee](https://exploreoakridge.com), one of the secret cities of the Manhattan Project.
