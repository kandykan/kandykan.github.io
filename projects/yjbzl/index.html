When a small breeze blows by, it sways back and forth. In the misty fog, a kite sways gently back and forth. It is dark, and the street lights begin to glow, yellow lights too thick to dissipate. The fog settles heavily, the lights dim and hazy in the fog… It is dark. I curl up at the corner of the bed. It is dark, it is dark. I don’t dare to turn on the light. I want to hide in the dark. Yes, I am hiding from something. What am I hiding from? A gust of wind blows in, bringing in a slight chill. That singing, that faint sound of singing, has come again, come again, “Where I come from, nobody knows… And where I’m going, everything goes… The wind blows… The sea flows…” I wave my hands, wanting to shoo away the song, but it floats in again and again, floats into my room. It fills me, fills me up… It’s coming. It’s finally here. I’m afraid, so afraid. I jump up and flee to my mother’s room. I clutch her in a craze, “Mom! Tell me, tell me, I’m not Jennie, I’m not Jennie… I’m not her… Not really, really…”</p> <p>It’s been many days, many days since I’ve been lost in this hallucination.</p> <p><em>Portrait of Jennie</em> is a movie I saw when I was a child, but I haven’t been able to remember it clearly in recent years. When I occasionally talk to some friends about it, I only remember that it was a good movie. It had a very beautiful story with a lot of atmosphere, very sad and romantic.</p> <p>About a year ago, my cousin called me and said that he heard news of <em>Portrait of Jennie</em> being remade. I said that it was a good film but that I didn’t remember much. He casually hummed through the phone the little song Jennie often sang— “Where I come from, nobody knows, and where I’m going… Everything goes. The wind blows, the sea flows, and where I’m going… Everything…” Holding the receiver, I shouted like I was possessed, “This tune, this tune… I know it… I’ve heard it, I’ve definitely heard it. No, not from the movie. It seems like it was a long time ago, before, I don’t know, in some other world… I just have this memory that’s sealed off! I’m not lying to you. It was in another world. That wind! That sea! That faint, gloomy sound of singing… Don’t keep asking me, cousin, I don’t know how to put it in words. It’s just that song, that song…”</p> <p>That night, I fell ill. I had a high fever, and Jennie’s singing rose up like a tide. It seeped into my whole body, and I was violently enveloped by an indescribable feeling. This was it! This was it! This was the world I sought, the source of my nostalgia.</p> <p>After recovering from that illness, I rested for a while. The doctor tried his best to make me sleep, didn’t give me any time to think, and didn’t give me any stimulus. Slowly, ostensibly, I calmed down. One day, on a whim and without my mother’s consent, I decided to run outside, carrying my drawing supplies, to sketch <em>en plein air</em>. My mother heard the noises and chased after me. She grabbed my clothes and pleaded, “Child, you are still not well. Don’t go out and catch a chill. Listen to me! Go back inside! Come, listen…” Suddenly, for some reason, I burst into tears. I pounded the door desperately and shouted in a craze, “Leave me alone, let me go… Let me go… I hate… I hate you all…” I felt suffocated, so suffocated I could explode. <em>I’m suffocating, I’m suffocating…</em> Carrying the box of supplies, I ran out of the house like a gust of wind.</p> <p>Sitting on a ridge, I set up the easel. Looking around as far as the eye could see, there was nothing to see except for vast paddy fields and distant mountains. The more the wind blew, the stronger it grew. I felt very cold. I turned up the collar of my jacket, but it was of no help. I was starting to regret my willfulness and haste. Facing the blank canvas, I couldn’t draw a single stroke. I just sat there stupidly, listening to the wind around me. At some point, I felt the sound of the wind gradually growing fainter, and a silence full of longing surrounded me. Slowly, it seemed like there was a kind of music taking the place of the sound of the wind, floating in from the distance. The sound rode along the undulating waves of wheat, drawing nearer… Finally it surrounded me. It sang in my ears, “Where I come from, nobody knows, and where I’m going, everything goes…”</p> <p>I jumped up and stood there blankly. The extreme panic that overtook me almost made me numb. Afterward, I overturned the easel and couldn’t help but run wildly into the open fields. Oh, Jennie was here! Jennie was here! I ran, I ran, I ran into that world that had been sealed off. There was darkness all around. Except for Jennie’s sad and gloomy voice, there was nothing at all. It was utterly destitute, and I was utterly destitute. I opened my arms and grabbed wildly at the sky. I ran ahead. There was darkness all around. I was seeking, I was seeking something that could not be lost, I was seeking… Darkness. All of creation was gone, except for Jennie, Jennie… I kept running non-stop…</p> <p>That night, I was sent home by a farmer who found me in a small ditch in the fields. My family had been worried that I hadn’t returned. My mother was so distressed when she saw me that she began to cry. She hugged me and said, “Child, how did you end up in this shape!” I gazed at her silently, <em>Oh! Mom, I was just seeking, seeking…</em></p> <p>After a week of being sick in a daze, I was clamoring to get out of bed. The doctor, and my father and mother together agreed on a few simple rules for me to follow. I was only allowed to paint still-lifes, read books, and listen to records in the house. I was not to go running wildly over hill and dale again. They told me I was sick. (I was sick?) <em>In the future, don’t think too much, don’t watch too much, don’t be self-willed, don’t be angry, don’t cry for no reason, don’t do this, don’t do that, too many things not to do…</em></p> <p>I was shut inside at home for almost a month. I only went out once. That day, my mother took me to NTU Hospital. She said that there was a good doctor who could treat my illness. We walked for a little while, and it wasn’t until we reached the door of the psychiatric ward that I stopped in surprise. So… Was I…? My mother left, leaving only the doctor and me. He tried to ask me like a friend, “You draw?” I nodded but felt disgusted with this doctor who pretended to be sympathetic—Jennie’s relationship with me was not an illness. He smiled and asked me again like he was an art connoisseur, “Do you paint that kind… Ah! What is it called… The blurry kind… Impressionism?” I couldn’t bear it anymore. I stood up and said to him impatiently, “Impressionism was a school in the nineteenth century. It has nothing to do with current abstract art. If you don’t understand this, don’t treat me. Also, I’m not dead yet. Don’t look at me like that.” Jennie’s relationship with me was not an illness. It was not an illness. I understood this. I really understood this. My body was just in poor health. I was not sick.</p> <p>Jennie still came looking for me all the time, in the dead of night, on rainy evenings, in the pale morning light, on gloomy days… She came as soon as she said she would, with her song and her characteristic breath. Time and time again I fell into that world of nothingness, gasping for breath, running, seeking… seeking… running… waking up covered in sweat, exhausted and inconsolable. I was just as lost in Jennie’s singing. I felt so delirious that my head spun. I felt the pain of fading away. Even so, from those feelings, I experienced a kind of happiness that was etched in my memory and a kind of intense paradoxical heartache.</p> <p>I don’t know when it started. I was already intoxicated by that world and couldn’t extricate myself. Although I was scared and conflicted, I still had an attachment to the thrill of it that I couldn’t explain. Day and night, I fled. I also sought. I knew I had already become one with Jennie. I knew. I truly knew. “Jennie, Jennie!” I cried out softly. We were one.</p> <p>As usual, every Tuesday and Friday were the days for my injections. One evening, I grabbed the medicine and syringe, let my family know, and went to see the doctor who had taken care of me since I was young—Uncle Zhang. Uncle Zhang gazed at me with concern and said, “Child, you’ve gotten even thinner!” I started to panic as if I’d been exposed for committing a crime—what did I do wrong? I hung my head and said haltingly, “Uncle Zhang, I have insomnia, you know, I often can’t fall asleep. Sleeping pills are useless—” He lifted my chin, and gently, but firmly said, “You are not happy, why?”</p> <p>“I’m not happy? Really? Uncle Zhang, you are mistaken. I am happy. I am happy… Really… It’s ridiculous to say that I’m not happy. Jennie is here, you know, Jennie is here. I am satisfied. I am satisfied… Even though I keep running there! Running! But I am satisfied… Really… Am I in pain? A little… Isn’t that good? I—Oh! Oh my God, don’t look at me like that! Uncle Zhang, I’m really not sick. I’m fine… Really fine…</p> <p>I found that I was talking non-stop, hysterically, and tears were streaming down my face. I couldn’t control myself, and I couldn’t stop talking. Uncle Zhang silently took my hand and accompanied me home. The whole way back, he said, as if trying to hypnotize me, “Child, you are sick. You are sick. There is no Jennie. There is no Jennie. You need to be calm, be calm… You are sick…”</p> <p>Injections, medications, psychotherapy, sedatives, excessive doting, all were useless. Jennie still lives inside me. I feel that Jennie not only possesses me but is also about to replace me. One day, one day, I will disappear, disappear without a trace. It will no longer be me that is alive. I will no longer exist. I will disappear…</p> <p>Again and again, I attempt to say, <em>Jennie! Let’s break up! Let’s break up!</em> She does not answer me, only sings to me with that faint and hollow voice, “Where I come from, nobody knows, and where I’m going, everything goes. The wind blows, the sea flows, and where I’m going… Everything goes…”</p> <p>Alas! Jennie! I’m coming. I’m coming to you. Then Jennie throws herself at me like a gust of wind, and I am once again sucked into her world without resistance, into that bleak, empty world. I’m running wild again… seeking… clinging to that decadent, self-tormenting satisfaction and unable to extricate myself.</p> <p>“Where I come from, nobody knows… And where I’m going… Everything goes… The wind blows… The sea flows… And where I’m going… Everything goes…” Jennie! Jennie! I’m coming. I’m coming to you…</p> <hr> <h2 id="autumn-love">autumn love</h2> <figure> <blockquote>This life is the crossing of a sea, where we meet in the same narrow ship. In death we reach the shore and go to our different worlds.</blockquote> <figcaption style="text-align: right;">--- Rabindranath Tagore</figcaption> </figure> <p>She sits in a small coffee shop in the Latin Quarter, gazing out the window, lost in thought, watching the wind sweep up the leaves on the sidewalk. Autumn is here.</p> <p>It’s been almost two years since she came to France. This is her second autumn. She wonders why today of all days, watching the wind and the fallen leaves, she can’t hold back the tears, can’t help but think of home and her mother and their goodbyes at Songshan Airport two years ago and her father’s silent reminders… It’s as if she hears herself whispering again, “Dad, mom, I’m leaving.” <em>I’m leaving, I’m leaving,</em> the same words she said a thousand times each morning when she left to go to school, <em>leaving, leaving…! Mom…</em> She leans back in the chair, tears dripping down her face. She opens up her purse to look for a handkerchief. She doesn’t like crying often, afraid that once she starts she won’t be able to stop. Why does she suddenly feel so downcast today? She lowers her head and lights a cigarette, at the same time scolding herself. She remembers a letter she wrote to her mother six months ago. She remembers saying, “Mom, I started smoking, but please don’t blame me yet. I’m not a bad girl, I just… Sometimes I feel so lonely and sorry. Xiaomei lives far away, so we don’t often see each other. Here, everyone grieves about life… Don’t persuade me to go back though. There’s no use. Even though I feel depressed here, I still love this life of drifting around…” She thinks about how she hated watching women smoke back home. She takes a long drag.</p> <p>The coffee is cold now, and she gets up to go back to her small loft, which doubles as a studio, that she rents for twenty dollars.</p> <p>Looking out the window, it is now dusk. Suddenly, she notices an unfamiliar young Chinese man outside the window watching her. It seems like he’s been standing there for a while. She stands there in a daze, unsure if she should call out to him. There are too few Chinese people here. Unless you deliberately go looking for them, you can go an entire week without bumping into any, or else it’s a group of overseas Chinese who speak a strange dialect and own a Chinese restaurant. He pushes the door open and comes in. “Sit!” she says hoarsely, pointing to the chair across from her. They don’t talk, instead just stare at each other in silence. She feels a little awkward and instinctively takes out a cigarette and lights it.</p> <p>“You smoke?” He shakes his head.</p> <p>The stout owner of the shop comes over with a cup of coffee and makes an excited face at her. He is probably happy for her. This pale and lonely Chinese girl who comes to drink coffee every day has finally found a friend! She finds it a little funny—should I be so happy just because he’s Chinese? She glances at him again. He seems so impenetrable.</p> <p>“I was watching you from outside the window for a while. Are you upset about something?”</p> <p>“It’s nothing, just a little homesick.” She takes a deep drag of the cigarette and glances away out the window. She’s afraid that he can see right through her.</p> <p>“Are you from Taiwan?” he asks.</p> <p>“Yes, from Taiwan,” she answers him slowly and clearly. She falls back into her chair as if a weight has been lifted from her.</p> <p>“That’s good. You know I had some misgivings about sitting down with a stranger.”</p> <p>“Me too,” she replies faintly but with relief.</p> <p>“Have you lived in Taipei? You know, my home is there.” She sweeps her hair back, not knowing what else to say.</p> <p>He does not answer her but instead watches her movements. “How long have you been in Paris?”</p> <p>“Less than two years.”</p> <p>“What do you do?”</p> <p>“Not much, just drawing.”</p> <p>“Life is okay?”</p> <p>“I brought some money with me when I came, and occasionally I can sell a small drawing…”</p> <p>He stays silent for a long time and says after a while, “Do you know what my first thought was when I saw you from outside the window?”</p> <p>She pretends not to hear his question, leaning down to poke at the ashtray. “Just now I asked you if you ever lived in Taipei?”</p> <p>“Yes, I have always lived there. I’m a sailor, and I will go back with the ship next spring. My mother and sister are in Taipei…” His voice turns hoarse, “Our occupation is just so much drifting around. One day you’re here, and the next day you don’t even know where you’ll drift to…” He chuckles darkly, his eyes betraying an uncontrollable loneliness.</p> <p>“China Merchants’ ships rarely sail here,” she says.</p> <p>“My ship is not China Merchants’. We fly the flag of Panama.”</p> <p>“When is the ship leaving?”</p> <p>“We got here yesterday, and we’ll leave for the Middle East early in the morning the day after tomorrow.”</p> <p><em>The day after tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.</em> She mutters to herself. All at once, she feels an overwhelming sense of nostalgia for everything. She has a sudden impulse to say to him, <em>Stay! Stay! If not for me, for Paris… Stay a few more days!</em> However, she doesn’t say anything. They are nothing more than two wanderers in a faraway place who happened to meet. They are just strangers who don’t even know each other’s names. She leaves money for two cups of coffee on the table, stands up, and says to him as if reciting from a script, “It was nice meeting you today. It’s late now, and I should go back…” She finishes speaking in one breath and runs out the door. She really hates herself. She knows she is lonely here. She needs friends. She needs happiness. She can’t keep crying like this and feeling homesick… He seemed like a nice boy. She hates herself. <em>Why run away, why not try? What am I looking for?</em> She staggers up her stairs, and when she reaches her apartment, she lies down on the bed and bursts into tears. She feels so lonely, so very, very lonely… The wall that she put up inside her for months completely collapses now.</p> <p>The next morning, she does not go to Professor Shi’s studio. Wrapped in a windbreaker, she walks alone along the chilly streets of Paris. She walks to the door of the coffee shop. Not long after the owner opens up, she subconsciously pushes open the door and walks in.</p> <p>At eleven o’ clock, she is still sitting there, the coffee already cold, cigarette ashes scattered all over the table. Her eyes, heavy with sleepiness, stare silently through the green smoke, and she mulls on a poem by Tagore: “For lover’s gift is shy, it never tells its name, it flits across the shade, spreading a shiver of joy along the dust. Overtake it or miss it forever.” Overtake it or miss it forever—he won’t come again. Yesterday, he just happened to pass by, and he won’t come again… She is surprised that she cried and cried so much last night, but today, even though her spirits are low, she doesn’t want to cry. She just wants to smoke, sit down, look at the fallen leaves and dead branches outside the window… Suddenly, in the reflection of the glass, she sees the door of the coffee shop open, and a tall figure comes in. He is wearing a windbreaker with the collar turned up. He comes over, stands behind her, and lays his hand on her shoulder. She does not turn around, only trembles slightly and says in a low voice, “Sit down!” Just like how it started yesterday, they stare at each other without saying a word. They both feel the strangeness of meeting this way in such a far-off place.</p> <p>He stretches his arm out and gently takes her cigarette away. “Stop smoking, I want you to really live life to the fullest.”</p> <p>Leaning against each other, they leave there in silence.</p> <p>The day passes quickly. They don’t rush to see the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Arc de Triomphe. They just sit on the stone chairs by the river and hold each other tightly, watching the running waters of the Seine, lost in thought.</p> <p>“What’s today’s date?” she asks.</p> <p>“The 27th, why?”</p> <p>“It’s nothing. I’ll be 22 years old in three days.”</p> <p>There is a flower stand by the road, and he walks over and buys a small bouquet of lavender daisies.</p> <p>“Bon anniversaire!” He says excitedly, and she takes it and nods. Suddenly there’s a lump in her throat, and tears are falling on the flowers… It is now dusk, and they begin to feel restless. Their time is running out. He takes her hand, puts the back of it against his face, and mutters hoarsely, “Don’t leave me, don’t leave me, don’t, don’t…”</p> <p>It is late in the evening now, and she knows the time has come. She has to go back, and tomorrow morning he will once again be out at sea. She gently throws the flowers in the river, the running waters quickly taking them away.</p> <p>Then, everything is over, and tomorrow each of them will go their separate ways. Life doesn’t care about time, doesn’t care about joy or sorrow, doesn’t care about love, hatred, gain or loss… Everything must pass, like those flowers, those running waters…</p> <p>My dear friend, if you passed by a small building in the Latin Quarter of Paris that night, you would see a pair of young lovers, weighed down with sorrow, kissing and embracing as if they would never see each other again.</p> <p>In fact, it would be the truth.</p> <hr> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Katherine J.
